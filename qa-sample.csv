What are the different types of waits in Selenium?,"* Implicit wait
* Explicit wait
* Fluent wait"
Implicit Waits," Implicit Waits set a default waiting time (in seconds) for the Selenium WebDriver to wait for an element to become available before throwing a NoSuchElementException. The wait time applies to all elements in the script. Once set, the implicit wait is maintained throughout the life of the WebDriver instance.


Syntax: driver.implicitly_wait(time_in_seconds)
"
Explicit Waits,"Explicit Waits: Explicit Waits allow the WebDriver to wait for a specific condition to be met before moving on to the next step. This condition can be the presence, visibility, or clickability of an element, or the absence of an element. The wait time is only applied to the specific element for which the wait is defined."

What is the difference between implicit wait and explicit wait in Selenium?,"Implicit wait is a type of wait where the driver waits for a certain amount of time before throwing a ""No Such Element Exception"". It is applied to all the elements in the script.

Explicit wait is a type of wait where the driver waits for a certain condition to occur before proceeding further in the script. It is applied to a specific element."
What is a FluentWait in Selenium and how is it used?,FluentWait is a class in Selenium that is used to define a maximum amount of time for Selenium to wait for an element to be present or visible on a page. It is used to wait for a certain condition to occur before proceeding with the next step.
What is a Page Object Model (POM) and how is it implemented in Selenium?,"Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern that provides a structured way to create object repositories for web pages in a Selenium project. It is implemented by creating a separate Java class for each web page in the application, and defining the elements and methods for each page in that class."
What is TestNG and how is it used in Selenium?,"TestNG is a testing framework for Java that is used in Selenium projects to manage test suites, run tests, and generate reports."
What is the difference between findElement() and findElements() in Selenium?,"The difference between findElement() and findElements() in Selenium is that findElement() returns the first matching element on the web page, while findElements() returns a list of all matching elements."
What is the difference between driver.close() and driver.quit() in Selenium?,"The difference between driver.close() and driver.quit() in Selenium is that driver.close() closes the current window of the browser, while driver.quit() closes all the windows and ends the session."
How can you handle alerts in Selenium?,Alerts can be handled in Selenium using the switchTo() method to switch the driver focus to the alert box.
